Story:
The Adversary was banished to outer darkness and the gate to the world was sealed with 7 seals. These seals were scattered (one per world region except graveyard), hidden (one per dungeon), and guarded (one boss each). Over time the Guardians have been corrupted by the Adversary through the seals and evil has returned to the land. The End of Evil cannot be achieved while the adversary lives. Many heroes have sought to bring about the End of Evil, but all have failed. Can you succeed where so many have failed?Basic Idea:
- Collect the seals from the guardians, use certain items in a certain place to destroy the seals & grant access to final dungeon to destroy the final boss
- Each seal must be destroyed using a specific item, in a specific location
- Clues about what item and what location are associated with each seal are located in both the overworld and the dungeons
- Expect to need a clue from both the overworld and a dungeon to know how/where to destroy a seal
- Clues might be freely given by people whose homes you visit (a-la "Its a secret to everybody"), you might need to pay for a clue or accomplish a task to receive the clue (i.e. "grumble, grumble"), they might also exist as engravings on tablets, cliffs, or dungeon walls

General Notes:
Top-Down view similar to LoZUse Tiled to build map(s)Tiles are 33x33 pixelsAll characters are a single tile (except Guardians)Use 4 canvases (visible, current, incoming, inventory)Any tile can be animated - and most should be
Only face/attack Up/Down/Left/Right
Zelda-like screen scrolling / inventory screen access
Most screens in the overworld should contain a secret (bombable wall, burnable bush, movable statue/rock)
Ability to carry bombs is an upgrade like the ability to shoot missiles in Metroid, you need to accomplish something before you can carry bombs

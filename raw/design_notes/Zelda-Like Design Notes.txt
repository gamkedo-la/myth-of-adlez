Story:
The Adversary was banished to outer darkness and the Gate of the World was sealed with the Seven Seals. These seals were scattered [one per world region except swamp], hidden [one per dungeon], and guarded [one boss/Guardian each]. Millenia of peace and prosperity followed where none suffered. Eventually the Guardians were corrupted by the Adversary through the Seals. Evil and suffering have returned. The End of Evil cannot be achieved while the Adversary lives. Many heroes have sought to bring about the End of Evil, but all have failed. Can you succeed where so many have failed?Basic Idea:
- Collect the Seven Seals by defeating the seven Guardians. Use a specific item in a specific place to destroy each Seal. Destroying all seven Seals opens the Gate of the World, allowing the player to enter the final dungeon and destroy the Adversary.
- Each seal must be destroyed using a specific item, in a specific location
- Clues about what item and what location are associated with each seal are located in both the overworld and the dungeons
- Expect to need a clue from both the overworld and a dungeon to know how/where to destroy a seal
- Clues might be freely given by people whose homes you visit (a-la "Its a secret to everybody"), you might need to pay for a clue or accomplish a task to receive the clue (i.e. "grumble, grumble"), they might also exist as engravings on tablets, cliffs, or dungeon walls

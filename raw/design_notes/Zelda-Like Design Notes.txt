Story:
The Adversary was banished to outer darkness and the Gate of the World was sealed with the Seven Seals. These seals were scattered [one per world region except swamp], hidden [one per dungeon], and guarded [one boss/Guardian each]. Millenia of peace and prosperity followed where none suffered. Eventually the Guardians were corrupted by the Adversary through the Seals. Evil and suffering have returned. The End of Evil cannot be achieved while the Adversary lives. Many heroes have sought to bring about the End of Evil, but all have failed. Can you succeed where so many have failed?

Basic Idea:
- Collect the Seven Seals by defeating the seven Guardians. Use a specific item in a specific place to destroy each Seal. Destroying all seven Seals opens the Gate of the World, allowing the player to enter the final dungeon and destroy the Adversary.
- Each Seal must be destroyed using a specific item, in a specific location
- Clues about what item and what location are associated with each Seal are located in both the overworld and the dungeons
- Expect to need a clue from both the overworld and a dungeon to know how/where to destroy a seal
- Clues might be freely given by people whose homes you visit (a-la "Its a secret to everybody"), you might need to pay for a clue or accomplish a task to receive the clue (i.e. "grumble, grumble"), they might also exist as engravings on tablets, cliffs, or dungeon walls

General Notes:
Top-Down view similar to LoZ
Each screen is 19/6 aspect ratio
Overworld is 15 x 10 screens
Zelda-like screen scrolling / inventory screen access
Most screens in the overworld should contain a secret (bombable wall, burnable bush, moveable statue/rock)
Ability to carry bombs is an upgrade like the ability to shoot missiles in Metroid, you need to accomplish something before you can carry bombs
Seals, Special Items, Temples, and Altars all have at least two names and we should alternate between them when giving the player information

Music:
	Any style (chip tunes or full orchestral, happy to take both)
	Overworld (or by region if we have enough music for that)
 	Dungeon (1 track for all but final dungeon, or 1 for each dungeon if we have enough)
	Final Dungeon

World Regions:
	High Desert: Sand, Sand Dunes, snakes, scorpions, emptiness (Temple of the Sun)
	Coastal Rocky Shore: Granite, Cliffs, Wind, Waves violently smashing the rocks, crabs (Temple of the Moon & Temple of the Night)
	Coastal Sand Beach: Sand & Surf, Tide that hides/shows rows/columns of tiles (Temple of the Sea)
	Red-rock Desert: Sandstone, Grand Canyon, Hoo Doos, lizards, snakes, cacti (Mountain Temple)
	Temperate Rain Forest: Tall Trees, Big Bears, rivers, lakes, rain, fish, big foot (Temple of Life)
	Graveyard/"Barrow Downs": graves, undead, spooky (Temple of Death)
	Swamp: dead stuff, undead, noxious fumes, dreary, will-o-the-wisps, getting lost (The Gate)

Moon:
	8 phases - Full, Gibbous, Half, Crescent, New, Anti-Crescent, Anti-Half, Anti-Gibbous
	Goes to next phase each night, so it's an 8 day "month" instead of 28 days
	Affects the tide based on phase. The tide is full in during Full Moon, full out during New Moon

Tools/Weapons:
	Club (given on first screen - It's dangerous to go alone)
	Copper/Steel Swords (can be purchased - maybe a fetch quest too?)
	Flint & Steel (burn bushes/light torches/etc after a random number of attempts)
	Bow (can be purchased)
	Arrow (cost 1 coin each, just like in LoZ)
	Bomb (Explosive bottle aka Molotov?)
	Key (unlocks any one door / chest)
	Skeleton Key (grants access to the Temple of the Void)
	Magic Key (unlocks all doors / chests)
	Shield (blocks non-magical attacks from the front when the button is held)
	Compass (1 per dungeon - not necessarily in the dungeon)
	Map (1 per dungeon - not necessarily in the dungeon)

Special Items:
	Wand of Fire / Sol's Scepter - Like the Blue Candle from the LoZ
	Boots of Quicksilver / Luna's Boots - Can move faster
	Cloak of Darkness / Nox's Cloak - Enemies cannot 'see' Adlez at night
	Bracers of Strength / Trident's Bracers - Club/Sword attacks deal more damage, can move stones
	Shield of Stone / Golem's Shield - Magical Shield -> also blocks magical attacks from the front when button is held
	Book of Life / Druid's Tomb - Slow health regen
	Sword of Death / Morda's Sword - Deals Magical Damage, more than the Steel Sword

Seals:
	Possessing a Seal attracts enemies from the dungeon it was retrieved from - this means Temple/Dungeon enemies in the overworld
	Destroyed Seals become fast travel devices that take you to the location where they were destroyed
